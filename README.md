### How it Works ?
We are setting up a system which works entirely on a community driven platform where people can join and choose to be a participant or not, and when someone is in need they can trigger a simple HELP button which notifies the volunteers in the select district of the one in need and to the district helpline informing about the help needed and volunteer details who are happy to help ensuring the safety of the one in need.

### Technologies used
Python, SQL, HTML, Javascript

### How to configure
Once logged in all we have to trigger a help button if they need any help

### How to Run
Instructions for running
