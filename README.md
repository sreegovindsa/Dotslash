### How it Works ?
This is completely a community driven disaster recovery and aid and support system where people can enroll and choose to be a volunteer or not, to make sure no one misuses this facility, we are collecting their Aadhar number, Contact number and working mail address. To make sure the mail address is real, we've set up a verification process where a 6 digit verification code  sent to the same mail will act as a proof for the existance of the mail.
<br>And whenever someone is in need they can trigger the help available in this platform and provide any required details so that it'll make it easier for the volunteers to act in a right and fast way

### Technologies used
